# TheToy

Welcome to your new gem! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/the_toy`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.

TODO: Delete this and the text above, and describe your gem

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'the_toy'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install the_toy

## Usage

```ruby
space = TheToy::Space.new # creates 5x5 square board
robot1 = TheToy::Robot.new(<nickname>) # Create robot that uderstand commands
robot2 = TheToy::Robot.new(<nickname>) # Create robot that uderstand commands
space.add_agent(robot1) # Syncronize robot with space
space.add_agent(robot2) # Syncronize robot with space
robot1.execute('PLACE 3,4,NORTH') # Place robot
robot2.execute('PLACE 2,1,SOUTH') # Place robot
space.print_map # See results
```

### Description
The application is a simulation of a toy robot moving on a square tabletop, of dimensions 5
units x 5 units. There are no other obstructions on the table surface. The robot is free to roam around the surface of the table, but must be prevented from falling to destruction. Any movement that would result in the robot falling from the table must be prevented, however further valid movement commands must still be allowed.

**Application can read in commands of the following form**

```
PLACE X,Y,F
MOVE
LEFT
RIGHT
REPORT
```

- `PLACE` will put the toy robot on the table in position `X,Y` and facing `NORTH`, `SOUTH`, `EAST` or
`WEST`.
- The origin (0,0) can be considered to be the `SOUTH WEST` most corner.
- The first valid command to the robot is a `PLACE` command, after that, any sequence of
commands may be issued, in any order, including another `PLACE` command. The application
should discard all commands in the sequence until a valid `PLACE` command has been
executed.
- `MOVE` will move the toy robot one unit forward in the direction it is currently facing.
- `LEFT` and `RIGHT` will rotate the robot 90 degrees in the specified direction without changing
the position of the robot.
- `REPORT` will announce the `X,Y and F` of the robot. This can be in any form, but standard
output is sufficient.
- A robot that is not on the table can choose the ignore the `MOVE`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT` and `REPORT`
commands.
- Input can be from a file, or from standard input, as the developer chooses.
- Provide test data to exercise the application.

### Constraints:
The toy robot must not fall off the table during movement. This also includes the initial
placement of the toy robot.
Any move that would cause the robot to fall must be ignored.

### Example Input and Output:
- **a)**

```
PLACE 0,0,NORTH
MOVE
REPORT
Output: 0,1,NORTH
```

- **b)**

```
PLACE 0,0,NORTH
LEFT
REPORT
Output: 0,0,WEST
```

- **c)**

```
PLACE 1,2,EAST
MOVE
MOVE
LEFT
MOVE
REPORT
Output: 3,3,NORTH
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
